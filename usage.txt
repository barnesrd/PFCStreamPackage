 All overlays are located in the html-overlays folder.
 To import these overlays to OBS, drag the file to the sources tab of a scene

 - Fuukabot Setup - 
 In order to use Fuukabot, you will need to edit the .env file in a text editor
 of your choice, and provide your channel's name. This is used to inidcate which
 channel the bot will connect to. 
 This bot is used to control values for the scoreboard via twitch chat.

 - Thumbnail Generator -
 The generator operates on json files that can be made within the program.
 Further instructions viewable in the Home page of the program.

 NOTE:
	If you would like to use any backgrounds for prematch overlays or
	for thumbnail backgrounds, you will need to place the image files
	in overlay/images/bgs. These images will need to be 1920x1080 to
	work correctly.
